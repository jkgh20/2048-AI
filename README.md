# 2048 AI

> Note: This project was originally forked under a different GitHub account; the forked project is [ovolve's 2048 AI](https://github.com/ovolve/2048-AI).

AI for the game [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).

See it in action [here](https://hk3yz.github.io). (Hit the auto-run button to let the AI attempt to solve it by itself).

The original algorithm that this project was inspired by was using an iterative deepening depth first alpha-beta search. This AI attempts to solve the game by simulating random moves before deciding which of four directions is optimal before making that move.
